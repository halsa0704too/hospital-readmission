# **Healthcare Patient Outcome Prediction**

## **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting patient outcomes based on medical data, including age, medical history, lab tests, and demographic data. The aim is to leverage classical machine learning techniques and modern deep learning approaches to make accurate predictions regarding patient hospitalization, medical procedures, and the likelihood of certain health outcomes.

## **Introduction**

The goal of this project is to predict patient outcomes, specifically:
- Whether a patient is at risk of complications requiring extended hospitalization.
- The type of medical procedures they will need.
- Whether they will need specialized care such as emergency/trauma or internal medicine.

The project implements several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Additionally, feature importance and model evaluation metrics are provided to assess the models' performance.

## **Getting Started**

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these instructions:

### **Requirements**
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- Required Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - xgboost
  - lightgbm
  - jupyter (for running notebooks)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-outcome-prediction.git
   cd healthcare-outcome-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Alternatively, you can install the required packages directly via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost lightgbm jupyter
   ```

### **Running the Code**

- **Data Preprocessing:** The preprocessing steps are implemented in `preprocessing.py` (or in the respective Jupyter Notebook).
- **Model Training:** Model training and evaluation can be done via the `models.py` script or `model_training.ipynb` notebook.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Results are stored and visualized in `evaluation_metrics.ipynb`.
- **Feature Importance:** Check the `feature_importance.py` script for a detailed breakdown.

## **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project includes various health and demographic features for patients, such as:
- **Age**
- **Medical procedures**
- **Lab results (e.g., glucose tests)**
- **Medical specialties**
- **Diagnoses (e.g., diabetes, digestive issues)**

The dataset also includes the outcome (target) variable, which indicates the patient's status or likelihood of complications.

### **Handling Missing Data**
- Missing data was handled through imputation or removal, as discussed in the code.

## **Preprocessing**

The following preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset:
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Imputation for numerical features, and dropping/categorization for categorical features.
2. **Feature Encoding:** Categorical features were encoded using one-hot encoding.
3. **Scaling:** Numerical features were scaled using standard scaling techniques.
4. **Outlier Detection:** Outliers were detected and handled as needed.

## **Models**

The following machine learning models were implemented:

1. **Logistic Regression:** Used as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability.
2. **Random Forest:** Chosen for its ability to handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data.
3. **XGBoost:** Used due to its efficiency in handling complex datasets and its gradient boosting framework.

The models were trained on the dataset, and their performance was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## **Evaluation**

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision:** The proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives.
- **Recall:** The proportion of true positives out of all actual positives.
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC:** Area under the ROC curve, representing the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between classes.

### **Results:**
- **XGBoost** performed the best, with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Random Forest** was a strong contender, showing good performance, while Logistic Regression was more limited in handling complex data relationships.

## **Usage**

To train and evaluate the models, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python model_training.py
```

This will execute the model training process and output the evaluation metrics for all the models.
